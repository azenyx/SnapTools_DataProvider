  "about_us_concept": "SnapTools was initially started in early 2017 as a way to provide Snapchat modifications, such as saving, with a new cloud based way of delivering fast updates. What we had in mind was a fully modular system that would allow all our code that interfaces with Snapchat to be downloaded in the form of \"packs\" from our server and stored and executed within SnapTools itself, allowing for multiple Snapchat versions to be supported, and for code updates to not require a new APK or a device restart.\n\nAs our knowledge of the inner workings of Snapchat grew, so did our project. We had established an incredibly capable framework and started adding features that many users requested, such as lens collection and management, screenshot bypass, and sharing from gallery, along with many others. We made our Slack page open to the public in August as we prepared for a pre-release, to attract attention and bring users to our community that could help with testing our product before our official release.\n\nNow it is open source. What a day",
  "about_us_description": "SnapTools started with Andre (andrerm124) as the sole developer, with Pedro (pedroc1999) and Gabe (quorn23) as part of the decision making team. Ethan (electronicwizard) also joined as a developer/tester and Michal (nightmean) helped while testing SnapTools and during the bug finding process. The majority of our team are currently in or recently graduated from higher level education.",

  "payment_model_reasoning": "SnapTools uses a <b><font color='#EFDE86'>Pay Per Version</font></b> model instead of a <font color='#EF8686'>monthly subscription</font> based system so that you only pay when you want to use a newer Snapchat version.\n\nThis aims to provide a cheaper method for our users, but still make it worth our time for maintaining the software.\n\nIt should be stressed that you are <b><font color='#EFDE86'>NEVER</font></b> forced to update to any version. You are free to use any premium packs you purchased for as long as you are able to use them.\n\nSnapTools also offers a <b><font color='#EFDE86'>7 Day Guarantee</font></b> so that if a pack for a newer Snapchat is released within 7 days of you purchasing a pack, you will automatically be given access to the newer pack as well."
