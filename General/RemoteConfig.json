  "about_us_concept": "SnapTools was initially started in early 2017 as a way to provide Snapchat modifications, such as saving, with a new cloud based way of delivering fast updates. What we had in mind was a fully modular system that would allow all our code that interfaces with Snapchat to be downloaded in the form of \"packs\" from our server and stored and executed within SnapTools itself, allowing for multiple Snapchat versions to be supported, and for code updates to not require a new APK or a device restart.\n\nAs our knowledge of the inner workings of Snapchat grew, so did our project. We had established an incredibly capable framework and started adding features that many users requested, such as lens collection and management, screenshot bypass, and sharing from gallery, along with many others. We made our Slack page open to the public in August as we prepared for a pre-release, to attract attention and bring users to our community that could help with testing our product before our official release.\n\nNow it is open source. What a day",
